# Cleanup

We deployed a lot of resources in these labs.  Clearly, you want to make sure they don't run up a bill from unused AWS resources.  This lab will help you clean up the resources you provisioned.



## The Nuclear Option
If you really want to stop AWS billing, close your AWS account.  If you've already stopped your active VM, you could close your account to make very sure no additional charges are incurred.  Alternatively, in the rest of the lab, we'll walk through less drastic options that allow you to continue to experiment and play with AWS.  But, if you prefer the nuclear approach, follow the instructions [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/close-aws-account/).
